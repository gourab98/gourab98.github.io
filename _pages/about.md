👨‍💻 I'm a recent Graduate from Software Engineering, IICT, SUST.

📊 My research interests are in Computer & Cyber Security, Privacy, Self-Sovereign Identity.

📚 Looking for PhD opportunities in CS for Fall '25.

# 🙋‍♂️ More About Me
I am passionate about writing code, experimenting with new technologies, and tackling challenging tasks. My interests span several cutting-edge areas, including security, self-sovereign identity (SSI) and identity management, machine learning, and virtual/augmented reality. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to develop a range of interesting and innovative projects. I am always eager to learn more and push the boundaries of what is possible with technology.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an active listener of audiobooks, particularly those that delve into historical events, podcasts as I find great value in understanding the past and its impact on the present.

# 🔬 Undergraduate Thesis
**Title:** Secure Storage of SSI Credential Using Solid Pod Technology.<br>
**Short Description:** This research addresses the need for secure backup and recovery methods in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) wallets, which store critical identity data and cryptographic keys. Despite the growing adoption of SSI, existing wallets often lack robust backup solutions. To tackle this issue, we propose Solid Pod, a cutting-edge technology that provides secure online data storage. I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Sadek Ferdous Ripul](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DnQAee0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as my thesis supervisor. **This work is presented at the [48th IEEE International Conference on Computers, Software, and Applications (COMPSAC)](https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2024/), Osaka, Japan, July 2024.**

# ✍️ Standardized Tests
- **GRE:** Quant: 161, Verbal: 141, AWA: 3.0
- **IELTS:** L: 8.0, R: 6.5, W: 6.0, S: 6.5
