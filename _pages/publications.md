## [Secure Backup and Recovery of SSI Wallets using Solid Pod Technology](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10633417)
Published in [48th IEEE International Conference on Computers, Software, and Applications (COMPSAC)](https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2024/), Osaka, Japan, July 2024. 

This paper proposes a secure backup and storage of SSI wallets using a novel technology called Solid Pod. It also presents the proposed approach's architecture based on a threat model and requirement analysis implementation details, outlines several protocol ï¬‚ows highlighting different use cases, and analyses its security, advantages, and limitations.
