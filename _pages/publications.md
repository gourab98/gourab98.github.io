## [Secure Backup and Recovery of SSI Wallets using Solid Pod Technology](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10633417)
Published in the [48th IEEE International Conference on Computers, Software, and Applications (COMPSAC)](https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2024/), Osaka, Japan, July 2024. 

A new paradigm for digital identity management
called Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has emerged to offer users
more control over their identity data. An important component of
SSI is a wallet that stores cryptographic keys and other identity
data. Secure backup and recovery methods for data stored in
such wallets are a crucial feature for its wide-scale adoption,
however, such a feature is lacking or implemented casually in
the existing SSI wallets. In this research, we propose a secure
backup and storage of SSI wallets using a novel technology called
Solid Pod. Solid Pod is an emerging technology that enables users
to securely store data online. Towards this aim, we present the
architecture, based on a threat model and requirement analysis,
of the proposed approach. We also discuss its implementation
details, outline a number of protocol ï¬‚ows highlighting different
use-cases and analyse its security, advantages and limitations.
